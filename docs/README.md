# dymoesco docs

These docs are written using sphinx.

The api reference is automatically generated by [autosummary](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autosummary.html). There's a bit of hacking necessary to make it output method documentation on single pages. See https://Stackoverflow.Com/A/62613202/4971151 for details that have been taken here.

With autosummary setup, we simply run `make html` to build the html outputs.
