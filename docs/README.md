# dymoesco docs

Sphinx documentation is found in the /docs directory.

The main api reference is found in /docs/_modules.
It is automatically generated by [sphinx-apidoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-apidoc.html) from the /docs directory by calling
`sphinx-apidoc -o _modules ../dymoesco`

The other api reference contained within the tables is generated by [autosummary](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autosummary.html), and is generated automatically thanks to `autosummary_generate = True` in conf.py.

To build the html outputs, we simply run
`make html`
